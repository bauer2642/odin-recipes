    <h1>Directions</h1> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>Season lamb shanks with salt and pepper.</li>
        
        <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook shanks until brown on all sides, about 8 minutes. Transfer shanks to a plate; set aside.</li> 
       
        <li>Add carrots, onions, and garlic to the pot and saut√© over medium heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in wine, tomatoes, chicken broth, beef broth, rosemary, and thyme.</li>
       
        <li>Return shanks to the pot, pressing down to submerge. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meat is tender, about 2 hours.</li>

        <li>Remove the lid and simmer to allow flavors to concentrate, about 20 minutes. Transfer shanks to a platter; cover with foil to keep warm. Continue boiling sauce until thickened, about 15 minutes. Spoon sauce over shanks before serving.</li>
